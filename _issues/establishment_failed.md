**Q**: Hasn't the establishment failed us?
  
**A**: No. President Obama inherited a [financial](http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2009/0218/p09s02-coop.html) disaster. And despite an [obstructionist Republican Congress](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republican-obstructionism-is-nothing-new/2016/02/15/2d856c12-d42c-11e5-b195-2e29a4e13425_story.html?utm_term=.7faadad9f0e1), look at [where we are now](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/magazine/president-obama-weighs-his-economic-legacy.html?_r=0):

* In 2009, unemployment reached a high of 10%; **today it is 5%**.
* We've had **73 months of private sector job growth**, the longest period on record.
* The Dow Jones Industrial Average was below 7,000 points in 2009, **today it is over 18,000**.
* And contrary to what many people think, our **federal deficit has declined by roughly three-quarters**.

**Q**: How has the current administration helped regular Americans?

**A**: The Obama administration fought for legislation to create jobs, close the gender pay gap, help people with "underwater" mortgages keep their houses, and provide access to health coverage for millions of Americans.

* President Obama pushed through the [American Recovery and Reinvestment Act](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/opinion/sunday/what-the-stimulus-accomplished.html?_r=0). The stimulus package prevented the United States from dipping back into recession. It **created 1.6 million jobs a year for 4 years**, and raised the nation's economic output by 2 to 3 percent from 2009 to 2011.

* President Obama's first official act was to sign the [Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/01/29/fact-sheet-new-steps-advance-equal-pay-seventh-anniversary-lilly) into law, which helped to **close the pay gap between men and women.**

* The U.S. Treasury created the [Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP)](http://www.harp.gov) and the [Making Home Affordable Program](https://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/pages/default.aspx). Both programs **help people impacted by the mortgage crisis keep their homes**. 

* And perhaps President Obama's crowning achievement, the Affordable Care Act (informally known as "Obamacare"), [**provides health insurance to 4.2 million people**](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/obamacare-affordable-care-act-104540)!

**Q**: Is there more to do? 

**A**: Of course there is! Hillary will continue to move our country forward, and fight for even more programs to help Americans who are struggling. Check out the [detailed plans](http://www.hillaryclinton.com) on her website.
