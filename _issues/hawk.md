**Q: Isn't Hillary a "war hawk"?**
  
**A**: No. A "war hawk" is considered to be someone who favors military use over diplomacy. That is absolutely NOT Hillary Clinton. Here are the facts:

* **Fact:** Hillary is a **diplomat first**. As Secretary of State, she [visited 112 different countries and logged almost 1,000,000 miles!](https://mic.com/articles/21829/5-top-highlights-in-hillary-clinton-s-secretary-of-state-tenure#.x0B1Hndr6) Hillary negotiated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, helped open Burma to the rest of the world, and pushed the sanctions that finally got Iran to the negotiating table. 

* **Fact:** Yes, Hillary voted for the Iraq War in 2002. However, she and the other 76 Senators who voted Yes were **told by the Bush administration that war would be the last resort**. On the Senate floor, [this is how Hillary explained the thought process behind her vote](http://www.thepeoplesview.net/main/2016/3/20/hillary-clinton-is-not-a-hawk-foreign-policy):

> Even though the resolution before the Senate is not as strong as I would like in requiring the diplomatic route first...**I take the president at his word that he will try hard to pass a United Nations resolution and seek to avoid war**, if possible. Because bipartisan support for this resolution makes success in the United Nations more likely and war less likely—and because a good faith effort by the United States, even if it fails, will bring more allies and legitimacy to our cause—I have concluded, after careful and serious consideration, that a vote for the resolution best serves the security of our nation.

* **Fact:** Hillary's critics have made Benghazi a "rallying cry." They've used the deaths of four American citizens, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, [to score political points](http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/14/politics/hillary-clinton-benghazi-committee/index.html) and to paint Hillary as incompetent and hawkish. They've even **admitted that the Benghazi investigations were politically motivated**.

Representative Richard Hanna (R-NY): 
> This may not be politically correct, but I think that there was **a big part of this investigation that was designed to go after people and an individual, Hillary Clinton**. After what Kevin McCarthy said, it's difficult to accept at least a part of it was not. I think that's the way Washington works. But you'd like to expect more from a committee that's spent millions of dollars and tons of time.

And this was Rep. Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) comment: 
> Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she's untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened had we not fought.

* **Fact:** Sometimes military action is inevitable...and justified. For example, **Hillary supported the raid that killed Osama bin Laden**. However, she chastised GOP Presidential nominees like Ted Cruz for their reckless and cavalier talk, such as ["carpet bombing" ISIS](http://www.npr.org/2016/05/17/478361999/4-things-to-know-about-hillary-clintons-approach-to-foreign-policy):

> Proposing that doesn't make you sound tough. It makes you sound like you're in over your head. Slogans aren't a strategy. Loose cannons tend to misfire. **What America needs is strong, smart, steady leadership to wage and win this struggle**.
