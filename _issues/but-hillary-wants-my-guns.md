Q: But Hillary wants my guns!


A: Not unless you're a terrorist, a violent criminal, or severely mentally ill.

> If you’re too dangerous to get on a plane, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in
America. (Hillary, June 13, 2016)

Here's what her campaign [website](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/gun-violence-prevention/) says:

* Expand background checks to more gun sales—including by closing the
gun show and internet sales loopholes—and strengthen the background
check system by getting rid of the so-called “Charleston Loophole.”

* Take on the gun lobby by removing the industry’s sweeping protection
for illegal and irresponsible actions (which makes it almost
impossible for people to hold them accountable), and revoking licenses
from dealers who break the law.

* Keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, other violent
criminals, and the severely mentally ill by supporting laws that stop
domestic abusers from buying and owning guns, making it a federal
crime for someone to intentionally buy a gun for a person prohibited
from owning one, and closing the loopholes that allow people suffering
from severe mental illness to purchase and own guns. She will also
support work to keep military-style weapons off our streets.
