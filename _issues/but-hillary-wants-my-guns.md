Q: Doesn't Hillary want to take away my right to own a gun?


A: Hillary respects law-abiding citizensâ€™ 2nd Amendment right to own guns. She just wants to put in place [common-sense solutions](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/gun-violence-prevention/) to make our communities safer. 

Guns kill [around 33,000](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/) Americans a year. Hillary is committed to reducing the epidemic of gun violence. 

Q: What do those solutions look like?

A: Here are the facts. As president, Hillary will:

+ __Expand background checks.__ [92% of Americans, including 87% of Republicans](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-agree-with-obama-that-more-gun-buyers-should-get-background-checks/) support expanding background checks for gun purchases. Currently, individuals can buy guns at gun shows or on the internet without a background check. Hillary will fight to pass legislation that closes these loopholes, as well as the [the loophole](https://www.thetrace.org/2016/06/one-year-later-and-the-loophole-that-let-the-charleston-shooter-buy-his-gun-remains-wide-open/) which allowed a shooter to gun down nine people in Charleston, South Carolina by avoiding a background check if the seller fails to complete the check within three days. 

+ __Hold accountable irresponsible gun dealers.__ Because of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, victims of gun violence [cannot hold liable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_of_Lawful_Commerce_in_Arms_Act) negligent gun dealers and manufacturers. Hillary will work to [repeal](http://www.courant.com/politics/capitol-watch/hc-hillary-clinton-sandy-hook-guns-story.html) this law and [revoke](http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/hillary-clinton-unveil-plan-major-new-gun-restrictions-n438361) the licenses of gun dealers who knowingly sell to traffickers and straw purchasers (individuals who buy guns on behalf of violent felons).  

+ __Keep guns out of the hands of violent criminals and those with severe mental illness.__ Hillary will support laws preventing domestic abusers from buying and owning gun. She will make it a federal crime to intentionally buy a gun for a person prohibited from owning one. She will close [loopholes](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/06/us/how-people-with-mental-illness-are-able-to-obtain-guns.html?_r=0) that allow people suffering from severe mental illness to purchase and own guns. And she will work to [ban assault weapons.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/06/13/clinton-calls-for-a-new-assault-weapons-ban-12-years-after-the-last-one-expired/)
