The Clinton Foundation is corrupt.

* **Fact**: The Clinton Foundation is a world-renowned charitable organization that has recieved top marks from independent charity watchdog groups. In [an interview with CNN](http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/08/24/charity-watch-clinton-foundation-lv.cnn), CharityWatch President Daniel Borochoff said:

>If Hillary Clinton wasn't running for President, the Clinton Foundation would be seen as one of the great humanitarian charities of our generation.

First, let’s take a quick look at the foundation’s history. The Clinton Foundation was founded by President Bill Clinton in 2001, originally to support the work of the Clinton Presidential Center, which contains his Presidential Library and supports the Arkansas community. President Clinton expanded the role of the foundation in 2002 to help improve global access to treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS. Since then, the foundation has continued to grow and take on new challenges, including battling climate change, fighting childhood obesity, and increasing opportunities for women and girls, to name just a few.

* **Fact**: The Clinton Foundaction [saves lives and has helped millions of people worldwide](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/the-clinton-foundation-explained/):
