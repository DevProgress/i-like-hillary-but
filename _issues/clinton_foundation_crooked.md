In [an interview with CNN](http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/08/24/charity-watch-clinton-foundation-lv.cnn), CharityWatch President Daniel Borochoff said:

> If Hillary Clinton wasn't running for President, the Clinton Foundation would be seen as one of the great humanitarian charities of our generation.
