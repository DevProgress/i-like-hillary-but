Q: Hillary has experience, but isn't it bad experience?  
  
A: In the first Presidential debate, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary "has experience, but it's bad experience." Well, like virtually everything Trump has said, this is utter nonsense. Hillary's record of public service spans four decades, starting with her first job out of law school. Here are just a few examples of [Hillary's many accomplishments](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/seven-hillary-clintons-biggest-accomplishments/):

*  [Children's Defense Fund](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/what-hillary-clintons-first-job-out-of-law-school-can-tell-us-about-who-she-is-today/): When Hillary graduated law school, she could have followed many of her peers and joined a prestigious law school. Instead, she chose to take a job with the [Children's Defense Fund](http://www.childrensdefense.org/), where she worked with teenagers incarcerated in adult prisons and families with disabled children.

* [Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/giving-hillary-credit-for-schip/): When Hillary was First Lady, she fought for health care reform. When that effort did not succeed, Hillary kept fighting. She worked with Republicans and Democrats to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program. CHIP cut the uninsured rate of American children by half, and today it provides health care to more than 8 million kids.

* [Health Care for 9/11 First Responders](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/9-11-survivors-applaud-hillary-clinton-dnc-supportive-article-1.2727482): Hillary had been the U.S. Senator from New York for just a few months when terrorists attacked us on 9/11. She worked tirelessly to make sure that the 9/11 first responders who suffered long term health effects from their time at Ground Zero got the care they needed.

* [Women's Rights](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/05/20-years-later-hillary-clintons-beijing-speech-on-women-resonates/): In 1995, Hillary spoke at the United Nations 4th World Conference on Women. In this speech, she famously declared: "If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights, once and for all!" As unaassuming as that sounds today, declaring that “women’s rights are human rights” was very controversial at the time. Many within the U.S. government didn’t want Hillary to go to Beijing at all. Others wanted her to pick a less "polarizing" topic. But Hillary was determined to speak out about human rights abuses, and her message became a rallying cry for a generation.

* [LGBT Rights](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/lgbt-equality/): As Secretary of State, Hillary made LGBT rights a focus of U.S. foreign policy. She lobbied for the first-ever U.N. Human Rights Council resolution on human rights and declared that “gay rights are human rights.” And here at home, she made the State Department a better, fairer place for LGBT employees to work.

* [Health Care and Family Leave for Military Families](http://correctrecord.org/hillary-clinton-a-record-of-service-to-veterans/): Hillary worked with Republicans to expand health care access for members of the National Guard and reservists, making sure those who served and their families had access to health care when they returned home. And she worked to expand the Family Medical Leave Act, allowing families of those wounded in service to their country to take leave in order to care for their loved ones.

* [Ceasefire between Israel and Hamas](http://www.politico.com/story/2012/11/clinton-announces-gaza-cease-fire-084145): As Secretary of State, Hillary never backed down when the stakes were high. During a brutal period of violence, Hillary cut short a trip to southeast Asia and flew to the region. The first bus bombing in years struck Tel Aviv just as Hillary arrived to begin an intense round of shuttle negotiations. But twenty-four hours after she landed, a ceasefire went into effect, and that year became Israel’s quietest in a decade.
