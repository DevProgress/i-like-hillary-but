**Q: Why is Hillary so cold, robotic, and unlikable?**

**A**: Well, first of all, the real Hillary Clinton is none of those things. Just ask the people who know her. The Hillary that some people think is real is the result of decades-long attacks by her critics, a psychological phenomena, and Hillary's admitted discomfort with the process of campaigning.

Imagine being in the public eye, at a national and even world-wide level, since 1992. Imagine that you had a vocal group of people that critized everthing you did, every word that came out of your mouth, every new hair style and clothing choice, the sound of your voice, your laugh, and your smile. Even her [cookie recipe](http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/16/opinion/swinth-hillary-clinton/index.html) created controversy. No kidding. That is the scrutiny that Hillary Clinton has faced for almost three decades.

Even before entering the public spotlight, Hillary learned that, as a woman, [she needed to keep her emotions in check](http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/150127870371/i-was-taking-a-law-school-admissions-test-in-a):
>I know that I can be perceived as aloof or cold or unemotional, but I had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions. And that’s a hard path to walk. Because you need to protect yourself, you need to keep steady, but at the same time you don’t want to seem ‘walled off.’

Donald Trump has no similar constraints. Frankly, no other Presidential candidate ever has. If Hillary is perceived as too serious, she is labeled "angry and defensive." If she expresses passion for the causes she has fought for her whole political life, she is "too emotional." But why is that? Well, [one study](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/emo/9/5/649/){:data-proofer-ignore="true"} indicates that it's because we perceive men and women differently. In this study, subjects were shown pictures of the faces of men and women in various poses. The subjects were asked if the person in the picture was likely being emotional, or responding to a situation. The study showed that in most cases, the women were said to be emotional, while the men were reacting to a situation. Unfortunately, [these stereotypes are playing out in this election](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/opinion/sunday/hillary-clintons-angry-face.html?_r=0).

And to top it off, Hillary knows that she is not [a natural politician](http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/hillary-clinton-i-am-not-a-natural-politician-220544).

>I am not a natural politician, in case you haven’t noticed, like my husband or President Obama. I have said before and it won't surprise anybody to hear me say it, this is not easy for me. It's not easy to do what I think is right to help people, to even the odds...and to know that I can make a difference and I want to in every way possible.

But cold? Robotic? Unlikable? These are not words those who know Hillary would ever use to describe her. On the contrary, those who know and have worked with (and for) her describe Hillary as ["brilliant," "funny," "thoughtful," "effective," and "a listener."](http://www.vox.com/a/hillary-clinton-interview/the-gap-listener-leadership-quality)

Here are quotes from people who know the real Hillary Clinton:

>"You hear people say, ‘She’s so different in person.’ That’s what they’re finding so appealing. When people don’t know her well and they encounter her, people are taken with the fact that she is interested in them." - John Podesta, Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton, Counselor to President Barack Obama, and Chairman of Hillary's 2016 Presidential Campaign

>"Hillary Clinton isn’t afraid to say black lives matter. She isn’t afraid to sit at a table with grieving mothers and bear the full force of our anguish. She doesn’t build walls around her heart. Not only did she listen to our problems, she invited us to become part of the solution." - Lucia Bath, mother of Jordan Davis

>"She knows that safeguarding freedom and security is not like hosting a reality TV show. It is a complex, round-the-clock job that demands not only a steady hand and a cool head, but also a big heart." - Madeleine Albright, former Secretary of State

>"I never once doubted that my parents cared about my thoughts and my ideas, and I always knew how deeply they love me. That feeling of being valued and loved — that is what my mom wants for every child. It is the calling of her life." - Chelsea Clinton

And yes, even Donald Trump had praise for Hillary Clinton, before he became her Republican challenger:
>"I think Hillary Clinton could do whatever she puts her mind to. I really do. She's incredibly dedicated to public service, she is smart as a whip, and she's effective." - Donald Trump

Hillary is truly a kind, friendly, and yes, likable person. But none of that is as important as being ready and able to lead this country. And that makes Hillary not only the better choice, but perhaps the best ever:
>"I can say with confidence there has never been a man or a woman — not me, not Bill, nobody — more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as President of the United States of America." - President Barack Obama
