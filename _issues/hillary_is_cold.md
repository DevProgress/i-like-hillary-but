Q: Why is Hillary so cold, robotic, and unlikable?  
  
A: Well, first of all, the real Hillary Clinton is none of those things. Just ask the people who know her. The Hillary that some people think is real is the result of decades-long attacks by her critics, and Hillary's admitted discomfort with the process of campaining.

Imagine being in the public eye, at a national and even world-wide level, since 1992. Imagine that you had a vocal group of people that critized everthing you did, every word that came out of your mouth, every new hair style and clothing choice, the sound of your voice, your laugh, and your smile. Even her [cookie recipe](http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/16/opinion/swinth-hillary-clinton/index.html) created controversy. No kidding. That is the scrutiny that Hillary Clinton has faced for almost three decades.
