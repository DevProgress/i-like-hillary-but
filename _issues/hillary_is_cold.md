**Q: Why is Hillary so cold, robotic, and unlikable?**
  
**A**: Well, first of all, the real Hillary Clinton is none of those things. Just ask [the people who know her](http://www.vox.com/a/hillary-clinton-interview/the-gap-listener-leadership-quality). The Hillary that some people think is real is the result of decades-long attacks by her critics, a psychological phenomena, and Hillary's admitted discomfort with the process of campaigning.

[John Podesta](http://www.vox.com/a/hillary-clinton-interview/the-gap-listener-leadership-quality), Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton, Counselor to President Barack Obama, and Chairman of Hillary's 2016 Presidential Campaign:
>"You hear people say, ‘She’s so different in person.’ That’s what they’re finding so appealing. When people don’t know her well and they encounter her, people are taken with the fact that **she is interested in them**."

[Lucia Bath](http://time.com/4424704/dnc-mothers-movement-transcript-speech-video/), mother of Jordan Davis:
>"Hillary Clinton isn’t afraid to say black lives matter. She isn’t afraid to **sit at a table with grieving mothers and bear the full force of our anguish**. She doesn’t build walls around her heart. Not only did she listen to our problems, she invited us to become part of the solution." 

[Madeleine Albright](https://www.demconvention.com/app_news/app_news_speeches/former-secretary-state-madeleine-albright-2016-dnc-speech/), former Secretary of State:
>"She knows that **safeguarding freedom and security is not like hosting a reality TV show**. It is a complex, round-the-clock job that demands not only a steady hand and a cool head, but also a big heart."

[Chelsea Clinton](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/07/28/chelsea_clinton_introduces_hillary_at_dnc_she_never_forgets_who_she_is_fighting_for.html):
>"I never once doubted that my parents cared about my thoughts and my ideas, and **I always knew how deeply they love me**. That feeling of being valued and loved — that is what my mom wants for every child. It is the calling of her life."

**Q**: So where does the myth that Hillary is unlikeable come from?

**A**: The myth has two main origins: [decades-long attacks](https://decorrespondent.nl/5072/clinton-derangement-syndrome-diagnosing-the-real-reason-that-so-many-americans-hate-hillary/1434615793424-45000115) by Hillary’s critics; and the [pressures placed](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/opinion/sunday/hillary-clintons-angry-face.html?_r=0) on female public figures.

* For two and a half decades, Hillary has faced attacks on everything from her [hairstyles](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2015/11/hillary_clinton_hair_attacks_from_the_headband_to_the_wig.html) and [clothing choices](https://www.bustle.com/articles/86973-5-times-hillary-clintons-style-was-criticized-instead-of-her-ideas) to the [sound of her voice](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/complaining-hillary-clintons-voice_us_579add5de4b0693164c0b55c), her [laugh](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/10/14/media-return-to-deriding-hillary-clintons-laugh/206136), and her [smile](http://fortune.com/2016/09/27/hillary-clinton-smiling-debate/) (or [absence of one](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/us/politics/hillary-clinton-smiling.html)). Even her [cookie recipe](http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/16/opinion/swinth-hillary-clinton/index.html) created controversy. 
* If Hillary is perceived as too serious, she is labeled [angry and defensive.”](http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/09/08/clinton-criticized-for-not-smiling-enough-during-commander-in-chief-forum/)If she expresses passion for the causes she has fought for her whole political life, she is ["too emotional."](https://thinkprogress.org/media-torn-over-whether-to-cast-clinton-as-weak-or-calculating-for-emotional-display-89faa9827964#.45qbd7hn2) 

**Q**: But doesn't politics and campaigining come naturally to her?

**A**: On the contrary, Hillary has acknowledged that [campaigning](http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/hillary-clinton-i-am-not-a-natural-politician-220544) does not come easy for her. Nevertheless, those who [endorse](http://www.chron.com/opinion/recommendations/article/For-Hillary-Clinton-8650345.php) Clinton [note](http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2016/09/27/hillary-clinton-endorsement/91198668/) that her emotional restraint and poise under pressure would help make her an effective president

Those who know Clinton best can attest that she is an empathetic, caring individual. But more important, they confirm that [she is ready](http://www.vox.com/2016/7/27/12306702/democratic-convention-obama-hillary-clinton-bill-qualified) to lead this country.
> "I can say with confidence **there has never been a man or a woman — not me, not Bill, nobody — more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as President of the United States of America**." - President Barack Obama
