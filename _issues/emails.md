Hillary is a criminal because she used a private email server
  
Although Hillary was not the first Secretary of State to use a private email account for business, she has stated repeatedly that her use of a private email server was a mistake. Additionally, an intensive FBI investigation showed that her actions were not criminal. Hillary used a personal email server merely for convenience, and not to circumvent security regulations, as her critics have claimed. Let's look at the facts:

* **Fact**: The FBI investigation concluded that there was **no criminal wrongdoing.** As we all know, on July 5th, FBI Director James Comey took the unprecedented step of publicly criticizing Hillary for her use of private emails. However, he went on to say that the FBI investigation showed that there was insufficient evidence of any criminal wrongdoing.  

* **Fact**: There were **no requlations against using a private email server** while Hillary was Secretary of State. During their investigation, FBI agents found there was “no restriction on use of personal email accounts for official business.”

* **Fact**: Hillary did not conduct all of her business on her mobile device. **Hillary had access to and used [Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_Compartmented_Information_Facility)** throughout her tenure as Secretary of State. She even had SCIFs in her homes in Washington DC and Chappaqua, NY. A SCIF is a secure area or room where sensitive information is viewed or discussed, and where secure telephone conversations are conducted. Hillary used SCIFs at home and around the world when necessary to view or discuss sensitive information.

* **Fact**: Only about a dozen people regularly emailed Hillary. **Very few people had Hillary's email address.** In fact, 68% of the email communications were between Hillary, and 3 top aides.

* **Fact**: Hillary strongly preferred in-person conversations and printed documents, often delivered via diplomatic pouch, over emails. **Most of her communications were done outside of email.**

* **Fact**: The three emails Hillary received containing classified information were not properly marked to indicate their sensitive content. FBI Director James Comey stated that the emails lacked the proper headers and banners indicating they were classified. He went on to say that **it would be a “reasonable inference” to assume that the emails were not classified.** Furthmore, to put things in perspective, of the approximately 40,000 emails sent and received on the private servers, **only 0.0048 percent** of those emails were even in question.
