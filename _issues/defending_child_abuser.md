**Q:** Didn't Hillary get a rapist acquitted, and then laugh about the girl who was raped?  

**A**: In the second Presidential debate, Donald Trump claimed "Her client she represented
got him off and she is seen laughing on two occasions laughing at the girl who was raped." This accusation [has been repeatedly disproven](http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-presidential-debate-fact-check/2016/10/trump-is-wrong-hillary-clinton-did-not-laugh-about-the-rape-of-a-12-year-old-229455#ixzz4MiTn0Cwt). Here are the facts:

* In 1975, Hillary was **the court-appointed attorney** for a man being tried for the rape of a 12 year old girl. 
* The defendant [specifically requested a female attorney](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/06/25/prosecutor-in-controversial-case-says-clinton-had-no-choice-but-to-defend-rapist/comment-page-1/). 
* Hillary was a young lawyer, only 27 at the time, and **did not want to take the case**. [According to the prosecutor, Mahlon Gibson](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/06/25/prosecutor-in-controversial-case-says-clinton-had-no-choice-but-to-defend-rapist/comment-page-1/), Hillary approached him for advice:

> {Hillary said} 'I don't want to represent this guy. I just can't stand this. I don't want to get involved. Can you get me off?' I told her, ‘Well contact the judge and see what he says about it,’ but I also said 'don't jump on him and make him mad.' She contacted the judge and the judge didn't remove her and she stayed on the case.

* The [Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution](http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment6.html) guarantees the right to an attorney. As a result, Hillary was **obligated to defend her client to the best of her ability**, which she did. According to Gibson:

> I would say she did a heck of a job of representing her client to the best of her ability. If you are appointed by the court, you damn better do everything you can do to defend them.

* The case resulted in a plea bargain, in which **the defendant was convicted** of a lesser charge.

**Q**: But how could Hillary laugh at a girl who was raped?

**A**: She didn't. This accusation stems from a recorded interview with an Arkansas journalist in the 1980's. In the **six minute recording**, Hillary can be heard chuckling a total of **four times**. However, she was laughing about ["unusual aspects of the case"](http://www.factcheck.org/2016/06/clintons-1975-rape-case/) and **never laughed at or about the victim**.
