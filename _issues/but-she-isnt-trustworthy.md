politicians to have been in the presidential races for the past 9
years!


* Politifact.org - an independent fact-checking organization that was
  winner of the Pulitzer prize in journalism has found that Hillary is
  second best overall in a field of 20 presidential candidates since
  2007 (the last 9 years). See
