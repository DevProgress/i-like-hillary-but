**Q**: Doesn't she lie all of the time?

**A**: No. Hillary is actually one of the most truthful politicians to run for President in the past three election cycles! Here are the facts:

* Politifact, a Pulitzer Prize-winning, independent fact-checking organization, determined that [**Hillary is the most truthful of all of the candidates who ran in 2016**, and ranks 2nd overall in a field of 20 presidential candidates, since 2007]  (https://datavizblog.com/2016/07/24/political-dataviz-who-lies-more-a-comparison-robert-mann/)!

* Just focusing on the general election candidates, [**Hillary is inarguably much more truthful** than Donald Trump](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/lists/people/comparing-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-truth-o-met/).

* Even one of her [long-time critics](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson) admits that Hillary is **"fundamentally honest and trustworthy"**.
