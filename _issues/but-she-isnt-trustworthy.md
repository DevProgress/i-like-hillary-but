## Q: Doesn't she lie all of the time?

**A**: No. Hillary is actually **one of the most truthful candidates** to run in the past three Presidential elections! Here are the facts:

* Politifact, a Pulitzer Prize-winning, independent fact-checking organization, determined that [**Hillary is the most truthful of all of the candidates who ran in 2016**, and ranks 2nd overall in a field of 20 presidential candidates, since 2007](https://datavizblog.com/2016/07/24/political-dataviz-who-lies-more-a-comparison-robert-mann/)!

* Just focusing on the general election candidates, [**Hillary is inarguably much more truthful** than Donald Trump](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/lists/people/comparing-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-truth-o-met/).

* Even one of her [long-time critics](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson) admits that Hillary is **"fundamentally honest and trustworthy"**.

## Q: If she's not a liar, where does this perception come from?

**A**: Aside from the almost three decades of [conspiracy theories](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/hillary-clinton-conspiracy-theories) aimed at destroying her reputation, there may be a psychological component to this perception. [Studies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/29/does-hillary-clinton-face-a-different-standard-for-honesty/) have shown that **women are expected to be more honest than men**. According to Julie Dolan, professor of political science at Macalester College, and the lead author of [Women in Politics: Paths to Power and Political Influence](https://www.amazon.com/Women-Politics-Paths-Political-Influence/dp/0205827152):

> Because the generic female candidate is presumed more honest than the generic male candidate, voters judge a female candidate more harshly if she appears to violate the expectation of honesty.
