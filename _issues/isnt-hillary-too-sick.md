Q: Isn't Hillary too sick to be President?

A: Hillary is a healthy woman.

In 2015, Hillary’s personal physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack, released a [statement](https://m.hrc.onl/secretary/10-documents/01-health-financial-records/2015-07-28_Statement_of_Health_-_LBardack.pdf) on her medical history. Bardack concluded:
>“Mrs. Clinton is a healthy 67-year-old female whose current medical conditions include hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies…. She participates in a healthy lifestyle and has had a full medical evaluation, which reveals no evidence of additional medical issues or cardiovascular disease…. She is in excellent physical condition and fit to serve as President of the United States.”

**Fact.** On September 11, 2016, Hillary, who [had pneumonia,](http://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/09/hillary-clinton-overheated/499514/) stumbled while leaving an event in New York City. Recovered, she [returned to the campaign trail](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pol-clinton-campaigning-20160915-snap-story.html) four days later. One of the most famous living journalists in United States history, Dan Rather, put [this into context](https://www.facebook.com/theDanRather/posts/10157417560045716):

>*But let’s be clear - barring any new developments this remains the story of a candidate working hard on the campaign trail who got a mild case of pneumonia and kept going when she maybe should have rested a bit. Everyone gets sick and until we have more proof of something severe, it remains a storyline to monitor but not belabor.*

Dan Rather has well over 40 years of context for Presidential campaigns: he ought to know what should be considered normal.
