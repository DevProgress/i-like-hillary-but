## Q: doesn't she just pander to the LGBT community?

**A**: Not at all. Consider these facts:

* Hillary supports the [Equality Act](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/matters-lgbt-42983248), which would **provide protection against discrimination** based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

* As Secretary of State, Hillary implemented several [LGBT-friendly policies](http://correctrecord.org/hillary-clinton-expanding-lgbt-rights-at-state/) at the State Department. These policies include: **modifying the equal employment opportunity policy** to “explicitly protect against discriminatory treatment of employees and job applicants based on gender identity”, providing **equal benefits to same-sex partners** of diplomats, **ending the old policy** that denied same-sex couples and families “the same rights and privileges” of straight diplomats, and working with USAID to create an **LGBT-specific brochure** to recruit applicants.

* In 2011, Hillary [delivered a speech](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/06/hillary-clinton-gay-rights-speech-geneva_n_1132392.html) in Geneva, Switzerland in recognition of International Human Rights Day. In this speech, she called for protections and recognition of the LGBT community around the world, stating "**gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights!**"

* Hillary was the **first First Lady** and **first major party Presidential nominee** to [march in a Gay Pride parade](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/the-times-hillary-clinton-marched-in-a-pride-parade-and-made-history/).

* Hillary has been [**endorsed by several LGBT organizations**](http://www.advocate.com/election/2016/3/14/hillary-clinton-gets-another-lgbt-endorsement), and enjoys the [wide support](http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/10/26/Hillary-Clinton-enjoys-wide-support-among-LGBT-community/7671477491695/) of the LGBT community.

## Q: But she flip-flopped on same-sex marriage, right?

**A**: Like many people, Hillary's views on same-sex marriage have evolved over time. In 2013, Hillary [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RP9pbKMJ7c) expressing **full support for same-sex marriage** "personally and as a matter of policy and law." As [Matt Baume at LGBTQ Nation](http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/10/watch-debunking-claim-hillary-clinton-bad-lgbt-people/) put it:
>Hillary has changed her position over the last 40 years — which is another way of saying she’s improved her position.
