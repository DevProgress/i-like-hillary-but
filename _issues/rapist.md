**Q:** Didn't Hillary get a rapist acquitted, and then laugh about the girl who was raped?  

**A**: In the second Presidential debate, Donald Trump claimed "Her client she represented
got him off and she is seen laughing on two occasions laughing at the girl who was raped." This is [completely false](http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-presidential-debate-fact-check/2016/10/trump-is-wrong-hillary-clinton-did-not-laugh-about-the-rape-of-a-12-year-old-229455#ixzz4MiTn0Cwt). Here are the facts:

* In 1975, Hillary was **appointed by a judge** to defend a homeless man who was being tried for the rape of a 12 year old girl. 
* Hillary was a young lawyer, only 27 at the time, and **did not want to take the case**. However, since she was appointed, she was not in a position to refuse.
* The [Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution](http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment6.html) guarantees the right to an attorney. As a result, Hillary was **obligated to defend her client to the best of her ability**, which she did.
* The case resulted in a plea bargain, in which **the defendant was convicted** of a lesser charge.

**Q**: But how could Hillary laugh at a girl who was raped?

**A**: She didn't. This accusation stems from [a recorded interview with an Arkansas journalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2f13f2awK4) in the 1980's. In the **six minute recording**, Hillary can be heard chuckling four times. However, as reported [in Politico](http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-presidential-debate-fact-check/2016/10/trump-is-wrong-hillary-clinton-did-not-laugh-about-the-rape-of-a-12-year-old-229455#ixzz4MiTn0Cwt):

> In the recordings, there are spots where Clinton chuckles — but never about the central thrust of the case.
