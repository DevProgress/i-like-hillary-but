    <p>Q: Why has the establishment failed us?</p>

<p>A: “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?” Ronald Reagan first posed this question during the 1980 Presidential campaign, and Americans have been asking it themselves ever since. This is the final year of President Obama’s second term, so to cover his entire Presidency, let’s consider what the current administration has done over the past eight years.</p>

<p>Has the establishment failed us? Take a look at just a small sampling of what the Obama Administration has accomplished and decide for yourself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>President Obama’s first official act was to sign the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/01/29/fact-sheet-new-steps-advance-equal-pay-seventh-anniversary-lilly">Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act</a> into law, which helped to close the pay gap between men and women.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>President Obama pushed through the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/opinion/sunday/what-the-stimulus-accomplished.html?_r=0">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</a>. The stimulus package essentially prevented the United States from dipping back into recession. It created 1.6 million jobs a year for 4 years, and raised the nation’s economic output by 2 to 3 percent from 2009 to 2011. The package also improved 42,000 miles of roads and fixed or replaced 2,700 bridges. It cleaned up water supplies, created the school reforms of the Race to the Top program, and greatly expanded the use of renewable energy and broadband Internet service.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Temporary Assets Relief Program (TARP) saved the financial and banking industries, and under President Obama’s leadership, <a href="http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2012/oct/25/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-banks-paid-back-all-federal-bail/">virtually all of the “bailout” money was paid back</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.harp.gov">Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP)</a> and the <a href="https://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/pages/default.aspx">Making Home Affordable Program</a> help people impacted by the mortgage crisis keep their homes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And perhaps President Obama’s crowning achievement, the Affordable Care Act (informally known as “Obamacare”), <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/obamacare-affordable-care-act-104540">provides health insurance to 4.2 million people</a>!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, are people better off now than they were in 2009? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/magazine/president-obama-weighs-his-economic-legacy.html?_r=0">Most Americans are</a>. Here are some facts about the health of our economy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 2009, unemployment reached a high of 10%; today it is 5%.</li>
  <li>We’ve had 73 months of private sector job growth, the longest period on record.</li>
  <li>The Dow Jones Industrial Average was below 7,000 points in 2009, today it is over 18,000.</li>
  <li>And contrary to what many people think, our federal deficit has declined by roughly three-quarters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there more to do? Of course there is! And Hillary will continue to move our country forward, and fight for even more programs to help Americans who are struggling. Check out the <a href="http://www.hillaryclinton.com">detailed plans</a> on her website.</p>
