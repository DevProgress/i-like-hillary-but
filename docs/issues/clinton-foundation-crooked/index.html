    <p>Q: Isn’t The Clinton Foundation corrupt?</p>

<p>A: Nothing could be further from the truth. The Clinton Foundation is a world-renowned charitable organization, and has recieved top marks from independent charity watchdog groups. The only reason it is being attacked now is because Hillary Clinton is running for President.</p>

<p>First, let’s take a quick look at the foundation’s history. The Clinton Foundation was founded by President Bill Clinton in 2001, originally to support the work of the Clinton Presidential Center, which contains his Presidential Library and supports the local Arkansas community. President Clinton expanded the role of the foundation in 2002 to help improve global access to treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS. Since then, the foundation has continued to grow and take on new challenges, including battling climate change, fighting childhood obesity, and increasing opportunities for women and girls, to name just a few.</p>

<p>Here are some <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/the-clinton-foundation-explained/">interesting facts about the foundation’s work</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2/3rds of people who have received HIV/AIDS treatment throughout the world have been able to so because of the Clinton Foundation.</li>
  <li>The Clinton Health Access Initiative partnered with governments to dispense lifesaving vaccines, which help save the lives of 50,000 children in Kenya, Ethiopia and Malawi each year.</li>
  <li>The Clinton Foundation, in partnership with Adapt Pharma, helped provide Naloxone, a drug that helps reverse the effects of heroin overdoses, free of charge to all high schools in the United States.</li>
  <li>Through the work of the Alliance for a Healthier Generation (which was founded by the American Heart Association and the Clinton Foundation), more than 18 million students in over 31,000 American schools, in every state, now have healthier food and more physical activity options.</li>
  <li>A remarkable 87% of the funds collected by the foundation went to charity.</li>
</ul>

<p>So while Bill, Chelsea, and yes, Hillary have all been involved with the Foundation, none of them has taken a penny in compensation. Nor have they used it for the ridiculous “pay-to-play” allegations recklessly thrown around by her critics.</p>

<p>But don’t take our word for it. Check for yourself with independent charity watchdog agencies. Agencies like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/bill-hillary-chelsea-clinton-foundation/478">CharityWatch</a>: who gave the foundation and A rating.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=16680">Charity Navigator</a>: who gave them a 4 star rating, with an incredible overall score of 94.74 out of 100.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.guidestar.org/profile/31-1580204">GuideStar</a>: which bestowed Platinum status on the Clinton Foundation, indicating the foundation’s commitment to transparency.</li>
</ul>

<p>In <a href="http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/08/24/charity-watch-clinton-foundation-lv.cnn">an interview with CNN</a>, CharityWatch President Daniel Borochoff said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If Hillary Clinton wasn’t running for President, the Clinton Foundation would be seen as one of the great humanitarian charities of our generation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Clinton Foundation truly is a world-class humanitarian charity. And that’s not coming from Hillary Clinton, her campaign, or the Clinton Foundation.</p>
