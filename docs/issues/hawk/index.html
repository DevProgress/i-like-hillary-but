    <h2 id="q-isnt-hillary-a-war-hawk">Q: Isn’t Hillary a “war hawk”?</h2>

<p><strong>A</strong>: No. A “war hawk” is considered to be someone who favors military use over diplomacy. That is absolutely NOT Hillary Clinton. Here are the facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hillary is a <strong>diplomat first</strong>. As Secretary of State, she <a href="https://mic.com/articles/21829/5-top-highlights-in-hillary-clinton-s-secretary-of-state-tenure#.x0B1Hndr6">visited 112 different countries and logged almost 1,000,000 miles!</a> Hillary negotiated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, helped open Burma to the rest of the world, and pushed the sanctions that finally got Iran to the negotiating table.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, Hillary voted for the Iraq War in 2002. However, she and the other 76 Senators who voted Yes were <strong>told by the Bush administration that war would be the last resort</strong>. On the Senate floor, <a href="http://www.thepeoplesview.net/main/2016/3/20/hillary-clinton-is-not-a-hawk-foreign-policy">Hillary explained the thought process behind her vote</a> as bipartisan support that would bring more allies and legitimacy to the cause.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even though the resolution before the Senate is not as strong as I would like in requiring the diplomatic route first… <strong>I take the President at his word that he will try hard to pass a United Nations resolution and seek to avoid war</strong>, if possible. Because bipartisan support for this resolution makes success in the United Nations more likely and war less likely—and because a good faith effort by the United States, even if it fails, will bring more allies and legitimacy to our cause—I have concluded, after careful and serious consideration, that a vote for the resolution best serves the security of our nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fact:</strong> Hillary’s critics have made Benghazi a “rallying cry.” They’ve used the deaths of four American citizens, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/14/politics/hillary-clinton-benghazi-committee/index.html">to score political points</a> and to paint Hillary as incompetent and hawkish. They’ve even <strong>admitted that the Benghazi investigations were politically motivated</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Representative Richard Hanna (R-NY):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This may not be politically correct, but I think that there was <strong>a big part of this investigation that was designed to go after people and an individual, Hillary Clinton</strong>. After what Kevin McCarthy said, it’s difficult to accept at least a part of it was not. I think that’s the way Washington works. But you’d like to expect more from a committee that’s spent millions of dollars and tons of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this was Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s (R-CA) comment:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she’s untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened had we not fought.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fact:</strong> Sometimes military action is inevitable… and justified. For example, <strong>Hillary supported the raid that killed Osama bin Laden</strong>. However, she chastised GOP Presidential nominees like Ted Cruz for their reckless and cavalier talk, such as <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/05/17/478361999/4-things-to-know-about-hillary-clintons-approach-to-foreign-policy">“carpet bombing” ISIS</a>:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Proposing that doesn’t make you sound tough. It makes you sound like you’re in over your head. Slogans aren’t a strategy. Loose cannons tend to misfire. <strong>What America needs is strong, smart, steady leadership to wage and win this struggle</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
