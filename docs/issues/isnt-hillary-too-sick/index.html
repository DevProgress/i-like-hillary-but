    <p><strong>Q: Isn’t Hillary too sick to be President?</strong></p>

<p>A: No, Hillary is in excellent physical condition.</p>

<p>In 2015, Hillary’s personal physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack, released a <a href="https://m.hrc.onl/secretary/10-documents/01-health-financial-records/2015-07-28_Statement_of_Health_-_LBardack.pdf">statement</a> on her medical history. Bardack concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Mrs. Clinton is a healthy 67-year-old female whose current medical conditions include hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies…. She participates in a healthy lifestyle and has had a full medical evaluation, which reveals no evidence of additional medical issues or cardiovascular disease…. She is in excellent physical condition and fit to serve as President of the United States.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Q: Then what happened at the 9/11 Memorial?
A: On September 11, 2016, Hillary, who <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/09/hillary-clinton-overheated/499514/">had pneumonia,</a> stumbled while leaving an event in New York City. Recovered, she <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pol-clinton-campaigning-20160915-snap-story.html">returned to the campaign trail</a> four days later. One of the most famous living journalists in United States history, Dan Rather, put <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theDanRather/posts/10157417560045716">this into context</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>But let’s be clear - barring any new developments this remains the story of a candidate working hard on the campaign trail who got a mild case of pneumonia and kept going when she maybe should have rested a bit. Everyone gets sick and until we have more proof of something severe, it remains a storyline to monitor but not belabor.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dan Rather has well over 40 years of context for Presidential campaigns: he ought to know what should be considered normal.</p>

<p>Q: Why did they say she was suffering from heat exhaustion rather than pneumonia?</p>

<p>A: Hillary’s illness at the 9/11 event was a result of overheating and overexertion, which is not uncommon when battling an infection like pneumonia. Thus the initial statement given by the campaign was accurate. Like many Americans, Hillary chose to continue working, even when ill, and did not share the information regarding her illness widely across the campaign. <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/hillary-clinton-falls-ill-9-11-memorial-n-y-n646376">It was only after this incident that Secretary Clinton and her campaign chose to spread the news of her illness and have her doctor comment further on her condition.</a></p>
