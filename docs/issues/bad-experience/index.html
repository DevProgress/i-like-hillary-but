    <h2 id="q-isnt-her-experience-all-bad">Q: Isn’t her experience all bad?</h2>

<p><strong>A</strong>: In the first Presidential debate, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary “has experience, but it’s bad experience.” This is not true. Specifically, he was referring to the <a href="http://correctrecord.org/the-path-to-a-landmark-deal-how-hillary-led-on-iran-sanctions/">Iran Nuclear Deal</a> and our <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/09/12/140292920/natos-intervention-in-libya-a-new-model">intervention in Libya</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Far from a failure, the Iran Nuclear Deal was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-obama-bet-that-paid-off/2015/09/15/e46b80f6-5be6-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html?utm_term=.225e39af4806">one of the most strategic successes</a> of the Obama administration. And the <a href="http://correctrecord.org/the-path-to-a-landmark-deal-how-hillary-led-on-iran-sanctions/">crippling sanctions</a> that Hillary personally fought for pushed Iran to the negotiating table.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hillary’s critics have convinced many people that the Libyan crisis began and ended with the tragic attack on our mission in Benghazi. However, the U.S. intervention in Libya helped avert <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/libya-protests-gaddafi-idUKLDE71L26D20110222">mass killings</a> by the Libyan government. It also led to the ouster and death of Moammar Gadhafi, a brutal dictator, terrorist supporter, and enemy of the United States. What if the United States had not intervened in Libya? According to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/07/libya-intervention-daalder_n_6809756.html">Ivo Daalder, President of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and the U.S. Ambassador to NATO during the 2011 Libyan revolution</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>We would have seen a massive humanitarian nightmare inflicted on the people of Libya by their government.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="q-what-were-hillarys-other-accomplishments-as-a-public-servant">Q: What were Hillary’s other accomplishments as a public servant?</h2>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Hillary’s record as a public servant includes her time as Secretary of State, U.S. Senator from New York, First Lady of the United States, and the First Lady of Arkansas. Here are just a <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/seven-hillary-clintons-biggest-accomplishments/">few of her accomplishments</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As Secretary of State, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2012/11/clinton-announces-gaza-cease-fire-084145">Hillary demonstrated her “shuttle diplomacy” skills</a>. During a brutal period of violence, Hillary cut short a trip to southeast Asia and flew to the region. A bus bombing struck Tel Aviv as Hillary arrived to begin an intense round of shuttle negotiations. But <strong>within twenty-four hours, the ceasefire went into effect</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Secretary of State, Hillary made <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/lgbt-equality/">LGBT rights</a> a focus of U.S. foreign policy. She fought for the first-ever U.N. Human Rights Council resolution on human rights and declared that <strong>“gay rights are human rights</strong>.” She also made the State Department a <strong>better, fairer place for LGBT employees</strong> to work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hillary <strong>worked with Republicans</strong> to expand health care access for <a href="http://correctrecord.org/hillary-clinton-a-record-of-service-to-veterans/">members of the National Guard and reservists</a>, making sure those who served and their families had <strong>access to health care</strong> when they returned home. And she worked to <strong>expand the Family Medical Leave Act</strong>, allowing families of those wounded in action to care for their loved ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hillary had been the U.S. Senator from New York for just a few months when terrorists attacked us on 9/11. She worked tirelessly to make sure that the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/9-11-survivors-applaud-hillary-clinton-dnc-supportive-article-1.2727482">9/11 first responders</a> who suffered long term health effects from their time at Ground Zero <strong>got the care they needed</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1995, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/05/20-years-later-hillary-clintons-beijing-speech-on-women-resonates/">Hillary spoke at the United Nations 4th World Conference on Women</a>. In this speech, she famously declared: <strong>If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights, once and for all!</strong> As unassuming as that sounds today, declaring that “women’s rights are human rights” was very controversial at the time. Many within the U.S. government didn’t want Hillary to go to Beijing at all. Others wanted her to pick a less “polarizing” topic. But Hillary would not be deterred; she was determined to speak out about women’s issues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Hillary was First Lady, she fought for health care reform. When that effort did not succeed, Hillary kept fighting. <strong>She worked with Republicans and Democrats</strong> to help create the <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/giving-hillary-credit-for-schip/">Children’s Health Insurance Program</a>. Today, CHIP <strong>provides health care to more than 8 million children</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="q-so-she-only-got-into-public-service-because-she-was-bill-clintons-wife-right">Q: So she only got into public service because she was Bill Clinton’s wife, right?</h2>

<p><strong>A</strong>: No. Hillary’s call to public service began before she married Bill. When Hillary graduated law school, she could have joined a prestigious law firm. Instead, she chose to take a job with the <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/what-hillary-clintons-first-job-out-of-law-school-can-tell-us-about-who-she-is-today/">Children’s Defense Fund</a>, where <strong>she worked with teenagers incarcerated in adult prisons and families with disabled children</strong>.</p>
